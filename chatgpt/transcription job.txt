Pekerjaan yang mengubah suara menjadi teks disebut sebagai speech-to-text atau transcription. Untuk melakukan pekerjaan ini, biasanya digunakan perangkat lunak atau software yang disebut sebagai speech recognition software atau speech-to-text software.

Perangkat lunak ini menggunakan algoritma dan teknologi pengolahan suara untuk mengubah suara yang direkam atau disalurkan secara langsung menjadi teks. Ada beberapa jenis perangkat lunak speech-to-text yang tersedia, baik yang gratis maupun berbayar, dengan berbagai tingkat akurasi dan kemampuan.

Beberapa contoh perangkat lunak speech-to-text yang populer antara lain Google Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe, Microsoft Speech Recognition, dan Dragon NaturallySpeaking. Namun, walaupun teknologi speech-to-text semakin berkembang, masih ada beberapa kelemahan dan batasan yang harus diperhatikan, seperti kesulitan dalam mengenali aksen atau logat tertentu, kesulitan dalam mengenali beberapa kata yang diucapkan secara tidak jelas atau terputus-putus, dan kebutuhan akan koneksi internet yang stabil dan cepat.
